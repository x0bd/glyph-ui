# GlyphUI Framework Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Implemented

-   [x] **Virtual DOM Implementation** - Creating, managing and efficiently updating virtual DOM elements
-   [x] **Mounting & Destroying DOM Elements** - Getting elements onto the page and cleaning up when they're done
-   [x] **Basic State Management** - Core reactive data handling with reducer pattern
-   [x] **Event Handling** - Basic system for attaching and managing event listeners
-   [x] **Component Rendering** - Basic component rendering system with props
-   [x] **Fragment Support** - Ability to render multiple elements without a wrapper
-   [x] **Stateful Components** - Components with their own internal state and lifecycle
-   [x] **Component Methods** - Adding custom functions to components for more control
-   [x] **Sub-components** - Composing components within components (nesting)

## üöß Coming Soon

### Components and Composition

-   [x] **Slots** - Content projection for more flexible and reusable components

### Performance & Rendering

-   [x] **Keyed Lists** - Efficiently rendering and updating lists with unique identifiers
-   [x] **Optimized Diffing Algorithm** - Smarter comparison for more efficient DOM updates
-   [x] **Lazy Loading** - Load components only when needed
-   [ ] **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Rendering components on the server for performance and SEO

### Development Experience

-   [üöß] **Hooks** - React-inspired hooks for state and effects in functional components
-   [ ] **TypeScript Support** - Type definitions and full TypeScript integration
-   [ ] **Browser Extension** - Developer tools for inspecting component tree
-   [ ] **Hot Module Replacement** - Update components without full page reload

### Advanced Features

-   [ ] **Asynchronous Components** - Handling data fetching and loading states
-   [ ] **Context API** - Passing data through component tree without props
-   [ ] **Error Boundaries** - Gracefully handling errors in components
-   [ ] **Suspense** - Declarative data fetching and code-splitting

## üìã Development Tasks

-   [x] Implement a basic component class with state management
-   [x] Create a more efficient reconciliation algorithm for DOM updates
-   [üöß] Design and implement a hooks system
-   [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration and type definitions
-   [ ] Build an initial version of developer tools

## üîç Performance Considerations

-   [ ] Benchmark rendering performance against other frameworks
-   [ ] Optimize memory usage for large component trees
-   [ ] Reduce bundle size for production builds
